FUN FACTS
FACT ONE: Have you ever noticed that all disney princesses have either straight or wavy hair? Well surely except for Princess Merida from brave. This is because 
animating curly hair takes a massive amount of time, work, and studies to make it seem realistic.  It actually took pixar three years of studying the 
physics of curly hair to accurately render Merida's hair, and TWO MONTHS just for creating the scene where she takes off her hoodie, revealing the volume of her hair.

FACT TWO: YOU! YES YOU! Do you know that you, a curly queen, have around 120,000 hairs on your head, whilst the average head only has 100,000 hairs?
I guess it's safe for you to tell anyone now, "Sorry but I'm unable to hear you over the volume of my hair." Keep it classy ladies ;)  

FACT THREE: There can be several different Curl types...ON ONE HEAD! Told you curly hair is wild.

FACT FOUR: Curly hair grows aproximately 6 inches yearly, so repunzel....let down your CURLY hair.

FACT FIVE: Get ready for this one because you're about to get bamboozled! Wavy hair can shrink up to 5 percent, curly hair can shrink up to 30 percent, 
and coily hair can shrink up to 75 percent of true length. Truly are hidden gems aren't they?
